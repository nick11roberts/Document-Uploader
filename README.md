PDF-Drive
=========

This is a free and open source Android application which allows users to upload images as PDF files to their Dropbox account.


This software is written using the ADT bundle available from (http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html), and so the folder structure follows
what is typical of the ADT bundle (which comes with the Eclipse IDE) 
or the Eclipse IDE with the ADT plugin (available from the Eclipse marketplace).
